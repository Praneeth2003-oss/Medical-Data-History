# Medical-Data-History
A SQL-based data exploration project on medical history data

# Medical Data History Project

This project involves comprehensive data exploration and SQL querying on a medical dataset consisting of patient, admissions, and healthcare provider information. The focus is on writing performant and insightful SQL queries based on real-world healthcare scenarios.


# Dataset Used

- File: - [admission.csv](https://github.com/Praneeth2003-oss/Medical-Data-History/blob/db5ad7db0c5877312ed2f74df706fd7f2292515a/admission.csv)
- Description: This dataset includes patient demographics, medical admissions, diagnoses, allergies, doctor information, and other health-related attributes.


# Objectives

The core objective of this project is to:

- Practice SQL querying on a healthcare database.
- Derive insights from patient and admission data.
- Perform data cleaning and transformation where necessary.


# Problem Statements

This project covers 35 SQL tasks across different difficulty levels. Below are a few examples:

- Retrieve male patient names and gender.
- List patients with no allergies.
- Filter patients by first names starting with ‘C’.
- Extract patients within a weight range.
- Replace NULL allergy values with 'NKA'.
- Concatenate full names.
- Join patient data with provinces for full province names.
- Count number of patients born in 2010.
- Find the tallest patient.
- Filter patients based on specific IDs.
- Count total admissions.
- Admissions with same-day discharge.
- Count admissions for a specific patient.
- Unique cities in province ‘NS’.
- Patients with height > 160 and weight > 70.
- Distinct patient birth years.
- Unique first names (occur only once).
- Names that start and end with ‘s’ and are ≥6 characters.
- Patients diagnosed with ‘Dementia’.
- Order names by length and alphabetically.
- Gender count in a single row.
- Repeat of gender count (intentional duplicate).
- Patients admitted multiple times for the same diagnosis.
- Most common patient cities.
- List all people with role as Patient or Doctor.
- Allergies ordered by popularity.
- Patients born in 1970s.
- Display full names in format LASTNAME,firstname.
- Provinces where total height ≥ 7000.
- Weight range for ‘Maroni’ patients.
- Admissions count by day of month.
- Group patients into weight groups.
- Compute BMI and identify obesity.
- Patients diagnosed with ‘Epilepsy’ under Dr. Lisa.
- Generate patient passwords based on ID, name length, and birth year.
